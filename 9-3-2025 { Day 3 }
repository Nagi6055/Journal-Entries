Journal Entry – Day 3
=======================
Today I studied Chapter 3 of the (ISC)² Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) certification, which focuses on Risk Management. This chapter introduced me to how organizations identify, evaluate, and handle risks that could impact their information systems and assets.


Studying Chapter 3 – Risk Management
-------------------------------------

I learned that risk is the likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability, and managing it is at the core of cybersecurity. Organizations must balance the cost of security measures with the value of the assets they are protecting.
Key concepts I studied today:

Risk Identification – Finding and documenting potential threats and vulnerabilities.
Risk Assessment – Determining the likelihood and impact of risks (both qualitatively and quantitatively).
Risk Response Options – Accepting, mitigating, transferring, or avoiding risk.
Residual Risk – The risk that remains even after controls are applied.

This chapter also stressed that risk management isn’t a one-time process—it’s continuous and evolves as systems, threats, and business priorities change.

Key Takeaways
-------------

^^ Cybersecurity is really about managing risk, not eliminating it completely.
^^ Effective risk management requires both technical and business understanding.
^^ Decisions about risk must align with the organization’s tolerance and goals.

Next Steps
----------
>> Continue to Chapter 4 to study security operations and incident response.
>> Look for real-world examples of risk management frameworks (like NIST RMF or ISO 27005).
>> Practice applying risk concepts to scenarios, such as identifying risks in common IT systems.

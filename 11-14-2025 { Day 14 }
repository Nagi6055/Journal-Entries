Journal Entry – Reviewing My Notes for the Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)

Today I spent time carefully reviewing all the notes I’ve taken throughout my Certified in Cybersecurity journey. Instead of learning new material or doing practice questions, I focused on consolidating everything I’ve written down so far — my summaries, definitions, diagrams, and key points. This review session gave me a deeper sense of clarity and helped me connect concepts that once felt scattered.

Reorganizing and Strengthening My Understanding

As I went through my notes, I realized how much information I’ve collected over the past weeks. Rereading everything brought back ideas from the early chapters and showed me how they link to the later ones. Reviewing my notes helped me reinforce:

The core security concepts like the CIA Triad, threat types, and common vulnerabilities

The importance of policies, standards, and procedures in governance

How risk assessments work and why risk responses must be strategic

The steps of incident response and the role of logging and monitoring

Key network security fundamentals, devices, protocols, and secure design

It felt good to see that many topics now make more sense than when I first wrote them down. The repetition is working.

Spotting Knowledge Gaps

While reviewing, I noticed areas where my notes were thinner or where I wasn’t as confident as I thought — especially around different types of controls and the reasoning behind certain risk decisions. This was a helpful reminder that studying isn’t just about reading but about identifying where to reinforce my understanding.

Building Confidence

The more I reviewed, the more confident I became. Seeing concepts explained in my own words helped me feel more prepared for the exam. It reminded me that I’m not just memorizing definitions; I’m building a real foundation in cybersecurity thinking.

Reflection

This session was quieter and more introspective than my active hands-on study days, but it was just as important. Reviewing my notes helped me appreciate how far I’ve come since I first opened the CC material. It also reassured me that I am getting closer to being truly ready for the exam.

Next Steps

Continue reviewing notes daily in shorter sessions

Strengthen the topics that still feel inconsistent

Complete more practice question sets to apply what I’ve reviewed

Stay consistent and trust the process

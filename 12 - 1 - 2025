Journal Entry – Setting Up HackTheBox & Reviewing Chapter One for the CC Exam

Today was a productive and exciting day in my cybersecurity journey. I took a step forward in both my hands-on practice and my certification preparation. I officially started setting up HackTheBox, and I also spent time preparing for the Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) exam by reviewing and practicing questions from Chapter One: Security Concepts.

Starting HackTheBox

I finally began setting up my HackTheBox account and environment, and it felt like opening a new door into a more advanced level of hands-on cybersecurity learning. From creating my profile to downloading the VPN connection pack, everything felt like a glimpse into real penetration testing workflows.

Getting familiar with the platform layout, the lab structure, and the concept of “machines” made me feel both excited and challenged. It’s definitely more technical than what I’ve worked on before, but that’s exactly why I wanted to dive into it — to push myself into deeper territory.

I haven’t started hacking machines yet, but just setting everything up made me feel like I'm preparing for something big. HackTheBox is known for sharpening real-world offensive security skills, and I’m looking forward to gradually working through beginner-friendly boxes and learning at a steady pace.

Preparing for the CC Exam – Reviewing Chapter One

Alongside my HackTheBox setup, I returned to CC exam preparation by going over Chapter One practice questions. This chapter focuses on the core ideas behind security concepts, and revisiting them reminded me of how foundational they really are.

Some key areas I reviewed included:

CIA Triad and why confidentiality, integrity, and availability matter in every security decision

Definitions of threats, vulnerabilities, risks, and assets

The concept of security controls and how they relate to protecting systems

Types of threat actors and their motivations

The difference between security events, incidents, and breaches

Answering the practice questions helped reinforce my understanding, especially in distinguishing between similar terms. I’m starting to see how these basic concepts influence everything else in cybersecurity — even the hands-on work I’ll be doing in HackTheBox.

Reflection

Today felt like a perfect balance between theory and practice. Setting up HackTheBox made me excited for the more technical challenges ahead, while reviewing Chapter One grounded me back in the core knowledge I need for the CC exam.

It was a reminder that cybersecurity is a blend of learning, practicing, experimenting, and constantly improving. Every tool, quiz, and concept is shaping me into someone more confident in this field.

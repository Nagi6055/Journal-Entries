Title: Chapter 4 – Network Security (Domain 4)
✅ Quick Summary
Chapter 4 covers Domain 4 – Network Security. The major topics include:
Understanding basic computer networking terms and models (e.g., OSI, TCP/IP) and protocols/ports (e.g., identifying secure vs insecure counterparts).

Recognizing common network threats and attacks (DDoS, man-in-the-middle, worms, trojans) and tools used to detect or prevent them (IDS/NIDS, IPS, antivirus).

Network security infrastructure: on-premises data centre considerations (HVAC, power, redundancy), cloud service models (SaaS, IaaS, PaaS) and deployment models (public, private, hybrid), secure network design principles (VLANs, DMZ, VPN, micro-segmentation, defence-in-depth, zero trust).

Emphasis on understanding secure counterparts of protocols and ports (for example: insecure FTP vs secure SFTP, Telnet vs SSH) and being able to identify port numbers, secure alternatives.

Summary of terminology, and reinforcing that for any cybersecurity professional—even if not specialized in networking—you must understand how networks operate, how they’re attacked, and how they’re defended.

📝 Important Aspects & Key Concepts
Networking models & terms: Knowing OSI vs TCP/IP layers, what each layer does, typical protocols; this helps you map vulnerabilities and controls to layers.
Protocol/port identification: E.g., HTTP → port 80 (insecure) vs HTTPS → port 443 (secure). Recognizing legacy/insecure services (Telnet 23, FTP 21) versus modern secure ones (SSH, SFTP).
HACKLIDO
Threats and attacks: Understanding how threats exploit network protocols and services, how attackers move laterally, and how design choices (like segmentation) matter.
Security infrastructure & design:
On-premises: making sure data centre physical/environmental factors are known (power, HVAC etc).
Cloud: Understanding service models and deployment models, what implications they have for network security.
Design concepts: VLANs, DMZ, VPN, micro-segmentation, zero trust, defense in depth. These aren’t just buzzwords—they reflect how you structure a network to resist or limit attacks.
Secure configuration and architecture as baseline: It’s not enough to know the threats; you must be able to think about how networks should be configured, segmented, controlled.
Terminology mastery: Many exam questions will test your ability to identify correct terminology or match terms to concepts. The learning objectives stress recognizing and using the correct terms.

Holistic view: Even though this is a “network” chapter, the goal is to see how networking fits into cybersecurity as a broader domain—not just bits and ports, but context, risk, architecture.
✅ What I Did in This Session
Read through all sub-sections of Chapter 4 (Network Security)
Took note of networking terms and models I was less familiar with (e.g., micro-segmentation, DMZ)
Reviewed a list of common protocols and ports and marked which ones have secure counterparts
Worked through examples of network threats and how they map to infrastructure weaknesses
Made flash-cards for the key terms/design concepts (VLAN, VPN, zero trust, defense in depth)
Self-quiz: matched protocols to ports, identified whether they are secure/insecure, and described one attack scenario for each major threat type
🎯 Areas to Review / Where I Felt Weak
The detailed distinctions between deployment models of cloud services (public vs community vs hybrid) and how those affect network security posture
More practice on port/protocol identification under time pressure (exam conditions)
Deepening my understanding of micro-segmentation and how it’s implemented in a network (practical examples)
Reviewing data centre physical/infrastructure terminologies (on-premises aspects) since network security isn’t just virtual
🚀 Next Steps
Review flash-cards and knowledge checks for Chapter 4 to reinforce weaker areas (especially ports/protocols & cloud deployment models).
Do a timed practice quiz specifically focused on Domain 4 (Network Security) questions to simulate exam conditions.
Use a network diagram (either self-drawn or sourced) and label components like DMZ, VLAN, VPN, NAC and think through how an attacker might move and how the design prevents it.
Move on to Chapter 5 (or the next chapter in your study guide) and follow the same routine: read, take notes, identify weak areas, make flash-cards.
At the end of this week, schedule a full-domain review of Domain 4 (e.g., one hour recap) before moving forward so it stays fresh in memory.
Begin compiling a “cheat sheet” of key terms, protocols & ports, design concepts from all chapters you’ve covered so far—for quick review before the exam.
Set a target exam date (if you haven’t already) and back-plan remaining chapters + revision so you have buffer time for review and practice exams.

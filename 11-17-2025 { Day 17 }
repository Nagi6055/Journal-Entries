Journal Entry – Continuing TryHackMe & Ongoing CC Exam Review

Today I continued balancing two major parts of my cybersecurity journey: building hands-on skills through TryHackMe and reinforcing my foundational knowledge for the Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) exam. The combination of practical labs and structured review is helping everything click into place more clearly.

Continuing Progress on TryHackMe

I spent more time exploring TryHackMe, and I’m starting to feel more confident moving through the different rooms. Each activity pushes me a little further out of my comfort zone, whether it’s navigating a file system, identifying vulnerabilities, or learning new tools.

What I like most is that TryHackMe makes complex topics feel approachable. Even when I’m unsure about something, the guidance helps me understand the why behind the task. I can feel my technical foundation slowly strengthening with every room I complete.

Ongoing Review for the CC Exam

Alongside TryHackMe, I continued reviewing material for the CC exam. I revisited my notes, practiced terminology, and refreshed important concepts across all five domains:

Security Concepts

Security Principles

Risk Management

Security Operations

Network Security

As I review, I'm realizing that many of these concepts show up directly in the activities I do on TryHackMe. Seeing the overlap makes the study process feel more purposeful and less abstract.

I also practiced a few questions today, not to test myself but to reinforce my understanding. The more I go over the material, the more confident I feel in my ability to break down exam-style scenarios.

Reflection

Today felt like a steady, productive step forward. I’m learning that cybersecurity isn’t about rushing — it’s about showing up consistently, reviewing what I know, and applying it in hands-on environments.

The mix of studying and practical work makes me feel more prepared every day. I can sense my knowledge deepening, my problem-solving improving, and my overall mindset becoming more aligned with how cybersecurity professionals think.

Next Steps

Continue TryHackMe beginner pathways to strengthen technical fundamentals

Keep reviewing CC materials and practice questions

Reinforce any weak areas before taking full practice tests

Maintain the balance between theoretical learning and hands-on practice

Journal Entry – My Cybersecurity Journey

Today’s progress in my cybersecurity path felt both productive and motivating. I continued setting up my HackTheBox environment, and even though I’m still getting used to the workflow—connecting through the VPN, checking machine statuses, navigating the interface—I’m starting to feel more comfortable with the platform. There’s something exciting about standing at the edge of practical, real-world challenges. HackTheBox feels like a playground for sharpening skills that I’ve only read about so far.

While the setup was finalizing, I shifted back to my Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) exam studies, focusing on Chapter Four questions. This chapter dives into network security, and reviewing the questions reminded me just how foundational these concepts are. Firewalls, network segments, protocols, secure design, defense-in-depth—there’s a lot to absorb, but it all clicks together in a way that makes sense. It’s like seeing the blueprint of how everything communicates, and how the smallest weakness in a connection can turn into a huge vulnerability.

Some of the practice questions really forced me to slow down and think. Sometimes the answers felt obvious, but the tricky wording made me reconsider my first instinct. I noticed I’m getting better at eliminating distractor answers and focusing on what the question is truly asking. It’s a good sign that my understanding is deepening, not just sitting on the surface.

There was something powerful about working through the CC questions while also tinkering with HackTheBox. It created a balance—studying theory while preparing to apply that theory in a hands-on environment. Seeing how network security principles tie into real attack paths made the material feel alive. It reminded me that the goal isn’t just to pass the exam, but to build real skills that matter in the field.

Today wasn’t overwhelming, but it was steady and meaningful. I can feel myself slowly becoming more confident, more curious, and more capable. Tomorrow I’ll keep pushing forward, moving one challenge, one question, one concept at a time.

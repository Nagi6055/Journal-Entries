Journal Entry – My Cybersecurity Journey

Today’s session was a blend of hands-on setup and focused exam preparation, and it felt like a solid step forward in my cybersecurity growth. I continued working on getting HackTheBox set up, and I’m finally starting to understand the flow of how everything works—the VPN connection, navigating the lab machines, and getting familiar with the interface. Even though I’m still in the early stages, just being in that environment makes me feel like I’m inching closer to the real-world side of cybersecurity.

Alongside the setup, I shifted my attention to the Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) exam, specifically going through the practice questions for Chapter Five. This chapter covers security operations, and reviewing the questions reminded me how broad and fast-paced this area can be. Topics like incident response, monitoring, logging, and basic forensics really stood out today. These are the operational skills that security teams rely on every single day, so seeing them laid out in question form made me appreciate their importance even more.

Some of the questions challenged me to think past simple definitions and focus on the purpose behind each concept—why logs matter, when an incident should be escalated, how different teams communicate during a response. It felt less like memorizing and more like piecing together how a real SOC environment operates. It also connected nicely with what I'll eventually be doing in HackTheBox: identifying weaknesses, analyzing behavior, and understanding security from an attacker’s and defender’s perspective.

Today felt balanced—part hands-on, part theory—but all progress. Setting up HackTheBox makes me excited for what’s ahead, while the CC chapter five questions showed me how much I’ve learned and how much more confident I’m becoming. Each day I can feel the material sticking more, and the idea of stepping into the cybersecurity field feels a little more real.

Tomorrow, I’ll keep building on this momentum. One step at a time.

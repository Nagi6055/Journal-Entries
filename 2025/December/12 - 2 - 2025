Journal Entry – Setting Up HackTheBox & Reviewing Chapter Two for the CC Exam

Today was another meaningful step forward in my cybersecurity journey. I continued setting up and getting familiar with HackTheBox, while also preparing for the Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) exam by reviewing practice questions from Chapter Two: Security Principles. Balancing these two areas made me feel like I’m building both my theoretical foundation and my practical skills side by side.

Continuing My Setup on HackTheBox

As I went deeper into HackTheBox today, I spent time understanding the platform’s structure and the types of machines and challenges it offers. I explored the dashboard, walked through the starting sections, and made sure my connection and tools were set up correctly.

Even though I haven’t launched into any serious hacking yet, the setup process itself helped me better understand how penetration testing labs operate. The idea of connecting to a private lab environment, interacting with virtual machines, and working through challenges feels like a major step up from what I’ve done before.

I’m both excited and a little intimidated — but that’s the exact mix of feelings that tells me I’m growing.

Preparing for the CC Exam – Reviewing Chapter Two Questions

Alongside my HackTheBox progress, I reviewed Chapter Two practice questions, which focus on Security Principles. This chapter dives deeper into the rules, frameworks, and access models that shape how organizations secure their systems.

Topics I reviewed included:

The differences between policies, standards, guidelines, and procedures

Security principles like least privilege, need-to-know, separation of duties, and defense in depth

The purpose of security controls and how they are classified (preventive, detective, corrective, etc.)

The AAA model (Authentication, Authorization, Accountability)

Access control models such as DAC, MAC, and RBAC

Working through the quiz questions helped me identify which areas I fully understand and which ones I need to reinforce. Access control scenarios in particular made me slow down and think, which is good — it means I’m learning how to apply these concepts, not just recite them.

Reflection

Today felt like a day where both sides of cybersecurity — the hands-on technical side and the core theoretical side — came together. Studying access control models and security principles gave me a solid framework, while setting up HackTheBox reminded me of where these principles are used in practice.

I’m slowly building the confidence and mindset of someone who can analyze systems, understand risk, and eventually test and defend real environments. It’s a long journey, but days like this remind me that I’m moving in the right direction.

Next Steps

Begin working on the beginner-friendly Starting Point machines on HackTheBox

Continue CC exam prep by reviewing Chapter Three questions

Strengthen my understanding of control types and access control models

Maintain consistency and keep documenting my progress

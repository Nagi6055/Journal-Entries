Journal Entry – Mini Quiz on Chapter Two: Security Principles

Today I continued my Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) exam preparation by taking a mini quiz for Chapter Two, which focuses on deeper security principles and how they guide organizational protection strategies. This quiz pushed me beyond just memorizing definitions — it tested how well I understand the purpose and application of these principles in real-world scenarios.

Taking the Mini Quiz

The mini quiz covered several important areas, including:

Different types of security controls (preventive, detective, corrective, deterrent, compensating, and recovery)

The concepts of authentication, authorization, and accountability (AAA)

Types of access control models such as MAC, DAC, and RBAC

The importance of least privilege, need-to-know, and separation of duties

The role of defense in depth and layered security

As I moved through the questions, I noticed how interconnected these ideas are. Security principles aren’t just theoretical — they influence every control, policy, and decision an organization makes.

What I Did Well

I felt confident in identifying the different types of controls and understanding their purpose. Questions about AAA and access control models were easier than before, which shows that the repetition in my studies is helping. I’m also getting better at understanding how principles like least privilege and separation of duties create stronger, more resilient systems.

What I Need to Improve

A few questions forced me to pause and think about context. For example, determining which control type fits a specific scenario or choosing the right access control model for a given environment wasn’t always straightforward.

This showed me that I need to review:

When each control is best applied

How organizations decide between different access control models

The logic behind layered security approaches

Understanding why something is used is just as important as knowing what it is.

Reflection

Working through this mini quiz gave me a clearer sense of my progress. It’s encouraging to see that the core ideas are sticking, and I’m beginning to think more like a cybersecurity professional — not just answering questions, but reasoning through them.

Chapter Two is a critical part of the CC exam, and today’s quiz helped reinforce how essential governance, control selection, and access management are to securing any environment.

Next Steps

Revisit examples of each control type

Review access control models and their differences

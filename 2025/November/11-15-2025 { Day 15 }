Journal Entry – Exploring TryHackMe and LetsDefend

Today marked an exciting step in my cybersecurity journey: I officially dove into TryHackMe and LetsDefend. Up until now, most of my work has been studying for the Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) certification, reviewing notes, and practicing concepts. But today I finally brought that knowledge into hands-on platforms designed to simulate real-world cybersecurity scenarios.

Trying Out TryHackMe

My first stop was TryHackMe, and right away I could tell this platform was built for learning step-by-step. I explored some beginner rooms and found myself actually applying foundational security concepts — not just reading about them.

I got to:

Navigate through virtual machines

Practice basic command-line tasks

Learn about different types of vulnerabilities

Follow guided explanations that made technical topics feel manageable

It felt rewarding to see that the theories from the CC certification actually show up in real pentesting and defensive tasks. TryHackMe made cybersecurity feel more like a practical craft, not just an academic subject.

Exploring LetsDefend

After that, I moved to LetsDefend, which had a very different but equally valuable focus. While TryHackMe leans more toward hands-on labs and hacking fundamentals, LetsDefend put me in the mindset of a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst.

I worked through:

Realistic incident handling scenarios

Log analysis

Email investigation exercises

Malware basics

I loved how LetsDefend showed me what it’s like to respond to actual security alerts. It made the concepts from Chapter 4 of the CC certification — like incident response, monitoring, alerts, indicators, and analysis — feel much more concrete. This platform helped me understand how all the theory turns into real-world decisions and actions.

Reflections

Today was a big confidence booster. I realized that I'm not just memorizing definitions — I'm learning skills I can actually use. Working with these platforms reminded me why I chose cybersecurity in the first place: the field is hands-on, dynamic, and full of challenges that require both analysis and creativity.

Seeing myself progress from studying to testing my abilities made me feel like I’m truly stepping into the world of cybersecurity.

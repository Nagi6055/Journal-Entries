Journal Entry – Continuing TryHackMe & LetsDefend, and Preparing for CC Review Tomorrow

Today I continued building my hands-on skills through TryHackMe and LetsDefend, and each session helped reinforce the concepts I’ve been studying for the Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) certification. The more I practice, the more I feel the connection between theory and real-world application — and that’s been incredibly motivating.

Progress on TryHackMe

I spent more time working through additional rooms on TryHackMe, and it’s starting to feel more natural navigating through the labs. I’m becoming more comfortable with basic commands, exploring file systems, and understanding how vulnerabilities can be identified and exploited.

Each room builds on the last, and I can feel my technical confidence growing. It’s slow, but steady — the best kind of progress.

Progress on LetsDefend

I also continued my training on LetsDefend today. The SOC-style scenarios are becoming easier to follow, and analyzing logs, suspicious alerts, and potential threats is starting to feel less intimidating.

I love how this platform forces me to think like a real defender:

What is the alert telling me?

What log entries matter?

Is this behavior normal or malicious?

It feels like each exercise sharpens my instincts a bit more.

Preparing for CC Review Tomorrow

Even though today was hands-on, I’m planning to shift gears tomorrow and dedicate the day to reviewing everything for the CC exam. I want to go over my notes, all five domains, and some practice questions so I can reinforce the concepts before moving forward again.

Hands-on learning is important, but so is making sure the foundational knowledge is strong, especially with the exam getting closer. My goal tomorrow is to slow down, refocus, and refresh my understanding of the core topics.

Reflection

I’m proud of the balance I’m creating between practice and theory. TryHackMe and LetsDefend are strengthening my technical skills, while the CC certification gives me the structure and knowledge I need to understand the “why” behind cybersecurity.

It feels like everything is finally coming together — one lab, one note page, and one practice question at a time.

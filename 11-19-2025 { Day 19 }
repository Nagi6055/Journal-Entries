Journal Entry – Mini Quiz on Chapter One: Security Principles

Today I focused my cybersecurity study session on Chapter One: Security Principles and tested my understanding by taking a mini quiz. It felt good to shift from reviewing notes to actually applying what I’ve learned. Even though it was a short quiz, it gave me a clear picture of how well I understand the foundational concepts — and what I still need to strengthen.

Taking the Mini Quiz

The quiz covered several core ideas from the Security Principles domain, including:

The structure and purpose of policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines

Fundamental concepts like least privilege, separation of duties, and defense in depth

The relationship between governance and security controls

The roles of stakeholders in enforcing security

How organizational frameworks support overall security posture

Answering these questions really helped reinforce how important governance is in cybersecurity. It reminded me that security isn’t only about technology — it starts with direction, strategy, and clear expectations.

What I Did Well

I felt confident with the definitions and the purpose of each governance document. Understanding why organizations rely on policies and standards made it easier to choose the right answers. Also, the principles like least privilege and need-to-know felt almost automatic by now, which shows that repetition is paying off.

Areas to Review

A couple of questions surprised me, especially the ones that required distinguishing when a specific type of control or document is used. It showed me that I need to keep reviewing not just definitions, but the context behind them.

I also want to revisit some of the security roles and responsibilities—like who approves policies versus who enforces them—just to make sure I’m crystal clear for the exam.

Reflection

Even though it was just a mini quiz, it gave me a confidence boost. It’s one thing to read about security principles, but it’s another to apply them in a test-style format. Today reminded me that I’m progressing steadily, building both knowledge and test-taking skills.

Chapter One sets the foundation for everything else, and solidifying this domain makes me feel more prepared for the full CC exam ahead.

Next Steps

Reread the areas I struggled with

Continue mini quizzes for the remaining domains

Keep reinforcing definitions and examples

Gradually build up to full-length practice tests

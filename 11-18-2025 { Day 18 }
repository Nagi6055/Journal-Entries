Journal Entry – Reviewing Notes and Key Terms for the CC Exam

Today I dedicated my study session entirely to reviewing my notes and key terms for the Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) exam. Instead of doing hands-on labs or practice questions, I focused on strengthening my understanding of the essential vocabulary and concepts that form the foundation of the exam.

Reviewing My Notes

I went through the notes I’ve been building throughout my cybersecurity journey — definitions, summaries, breakdowns of concepts, and the important takeaways from each domain. Reading through everything again helped me reconnect the dots between earlier topics and the ones I studied more recently.

The review also reminded me how much I've learned:

The purpose and importance of the CIA Triad

Different forms of threats, vulnerabilities, and attack types

How security policies, standards, and procedures guide an organization

Risk analysis and the types of risk responses

The stages of incident response and the importance of logging

Basic network components, protocols, and defensive strategies

Seeing it all together made the information feel more organized and manageable.

Focusing on Key Terms

I spent extra time reviewing the terminology, since the CC exam relies heavily on understanding the correct definitions. I went back over:

Security principles like least privilege, defense in depth, and separation of duties

Types of controls (preventive, detective, corrective)

Governance terms such as policies, standards, guidelines, and procedures

Network terms like firewalls, IDS/IPS, subnets, and protocols

Risk terms including likelihood, impact, and residual risk

Repetition helps a lot, and reviewing these terms again made everything feel clearer and easier to recall.

Reflection

Today was a quieter, more focused study day, but these are the kinds of sessions that make a real difference. Reviewing my notes and reinforcing the terminology gave me a stronger sense of readiness and confidence.

It also reminded me that mastering the basics is what will help me succeed on the exam — not just memorizing facts, but truly understanding what they mean and how they fit together.

Next Steps

Continue reviewing terms over the next few days

Move on to more practice questions

Identify weak spots and reinforce them

Stay consistent and keep building momentum toward the CC exam

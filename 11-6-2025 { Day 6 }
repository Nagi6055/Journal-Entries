## Journal Entry – Chapter 1 Practice Questions

Today I reviewed and completed the practice questions for Chapter 1 of the (ISC)² Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) certification. This chapter covers the basic concepts of cybersecurity, including the importance of protecting information, understanding threats, and applying foundational principles like the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability).

Practice Session Overview

Working through the practice questions helped reinforce my understanding of the key concepts and identify areas where I need deeper review. The questions focused on the fundamental purpose of cybersecurity, the different types of threats, and the core principles of security controls.

Some of the main areas covered included:

Information Security Goals – Understanding how the CIA Triad guides all cybersecurity efforts.

Threat Actors – Recognizing different types of attackers such as insiders, hacktivists, and nation-states.

Security Controls – Differentiating between administrative, technical, and physical controls.

Vulnerability vs. Threat vs. Risk – Clarifying how these elements interact to form the foundation of risk management.

Key Takeaways

Practice questions highlight not just what I know, but how well I understand the reasoning behind each concept.

The CIA Triad is more than theory—it’s a framework for evaluating real-world security situations.

Terminology precision is critical; small wording differences can completely change the meaning of a question or scenario.

Reflection

Completing this first set of practice questions gave me a confidence boost. It showed me that I have a strong grasp on foundational cybersecurity principles, but also reminded me to slow down and think through the logic behind each answer. Understanding the “why” behind every concept will be essential as I progress through more complex chapters.

Next Steps

Review the explanations for any missed questions to strengthen weak areas.

Move on to the Chapter 2 practice questions next to test my knowledge of security principles and governance.

Continue integrating theoretical learning with hands-on skills, like exploring how the CIA Triad applies to Splunk’s data protection and access controls.
